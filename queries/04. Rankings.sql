Insight:
1. Taste and activity shift 	
	- 2022: The year of prog, rock and metal - The Pineapple Thief, Soen, TOOL, A Perfect Circle, Porcupine Tree and Gojira dominate the top 1o spots
	- 2023: Heavy music activity and an even split dominance between prog rock and metal and alternative artist
	- 2024: Less music activity with alternative artists dominating which shows a taste pivot from the heavy music listen of 2022 and 2023
	- 2025: Even fewer music activity

2. Consistency: While taste and activity level changes, Manchester Orchestra and TOOL show consistent presence across time
